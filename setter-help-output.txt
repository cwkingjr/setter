  -c PMAPCONCAT, --pmap-concat=PMAPCONCAT
                        Allows default pmap name concatenation string of ' - '
                        to be overridden.  A node's pmap name is derived from
                        a reversed concatenation of the node's non-empty long
                        name and each ancestor node's non-empty long name,
                        separated by this concatenation string.  E.g.,
                        Grandparent - Parent - Child
  -d, --debug           Optional.  Dump debug (vice info) output to the
                        command line interface.  Debug-level output is
                        automatically logged to rotating log files and is far
                        easier to review there.
  -f, --print-file-names
                        Optional.  Print the names of files that would be
                        created (truncates if set-level option provided).
                        This is meant for use to check your setter-context
                        file configuration.  When used, setter will terminate
                        before creating the real files.
  -i SETTXTFILE, --in-file=SETTXTFILE
                        Setter text file to process. Default is ~/setter-
                        content.txt.
  -l LOGPATH, --log-path=LOGPATH
                        Path where you want setter.log file written. Default
                        is your home dir.
  -o OUTPATH, --out-path=OUTPATH
                        Path where you want files written. Default is your
                        home dir inside a date-setter folder.
  -O, --no-out-date     Do not include the processed date in the folder name
                        where output files are written.
  -p PMAPLONGLEVEL, --pmap-long-level=PMAPLONGLEVEL
                        Level restriction used when creating long-description
                        pmap files.  Default is all levels.  E.g., -p 1 would
                        create a long pmap file for level 0 and each level 1
                        entry.  Every level file includes records for itself
                        and all descendant levels.
  -P, --no-long-pmap    Do not create long (proper name) pmap files.
  -r PMAPSHORTLEVEL, --pmap-short-level=PMAPSHORTLEVEL
                        Level restriction used when creating short-description
                        pmap files.  Default is all levels.  E.g., -r 1 would
                        create a short pmap file for level 0 and each level 1
                        entry.  Every level file includes records for itself
                        and all descendant levels.
  -R, --no-short-pmap   Do not create short (file-name-based) pmap files.
  -s SETLEVEL, --set-level=SETLEVEL
                        Level restriction used when creating set files.
                        Default is all levels.  E.g., -s 3 would create a set
                        file for level 0 and each level 1, 2, and 3 entry.
                        Every level file includes records for itself and all
                        descendant levels.
  -S, --no-set          Do not create set files.
  -t, --print-tree      Optional.  Print a text representation of the tree of
                        nodes that will be loaded from setter-context.txt
                        (truncates if set-level option provided).  This is
                        meant for use to check your setter-context file
                        configuration.  When used, setter will terminate
                        before creating the real files.
  -v, --version         Indicates script version
